Description: corto is a simple package to infer correlation networks using DPI
  and bootstrapping to recover edges. An initial step is performed to calculate
  all significant edges between a list of source nodes ("centroids") and target
  genes.
  Then all triplets containing two centroids and one target are tested
  in a DPI step which removes edges. A bootstrapping process then calculates
  the robustness of the network, eventually re-adding edges previously removed
  by DPI.
