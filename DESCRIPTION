Description: We present corto (Correlation Tool) is a simple package to infer
  correlation networks using DPI and bootstrapping to recover edges. An initial
  step is performed to calculate all significant edges between a list of source
  nodes ("centroids") and target genes.
  Then all triplets containing two centroids and one target are tested
  in a DPI step which removes edges. A bootstrapping process then calculates
  the robustness of the network, eventually re-adding edges previously removed
  by DPI.
